name: trekoon
description: "Use for Trekoon-based planning and execution: epics, tasks, subtasks, dependency-aware graphs, status and progress, sprint or backlog work, and agent execution. Prefer whenever the user wants tracked implementation planning or Trekoon entity management, even if they do not say Trekoon."

# Trekoon Skill

Trekoon is the source of truth for tracked implementation work: plans,
readiness, owners, blockers, progress, verification evidence, and completion.
Use this file as the router. Load references only when the current mode needs
them.

## Mode Contracts

- `trekoon plan <goal>`: create an execution-ready epic.
- `trekoon <id>`: orient on the epic/task/subtask; report state, blockers, next.
- `trekoon <id> execute`: own the epic until done, hard-blocked, or needs user
  input. Use subagents by default for meaningful independent work.
- `trekoon <id> team execute`: same contract, using Claude Agent Teams only
  when the user explicitly asks and the environment supports it.

Do not stop at analysis when ready work exists. Do not invent a parallel plan
outside Trekoon.

## Load Rules

| Situation | Load |
|---|---|
| Any Trekoon request | This file |
| Plan, break down, design tracked work | `reference/harness-primitives.md`, then `reference/planning.md` |
| Execute, implement, complete tracked work | `reference/harness-primitives.md`, then `reference/execution.md` |
| User explicitly asks for Claude team execution | `reference/harness-primitives.md`, then `reference/execution-with-team.md` |
| Sync gaps, conflicts, shared-storage questions | `reference/sync.md` |
| Status transition error or status uncertainty | `reference/status-machine.md` |

`reference/harness-primitives.md` is required before planning or execution
because those modes may need local task displays, user questions, subagents,
review agents, testing tools, and Trekoon evidence recording.

## Route Input

Resolve the first non-mode argument as an epic, task, or subtask:

```bash
trekoon --toon epic show <id> 2>/dev/null || \
trekoon --toon task show <id> 2>/dev/null || \
trekoon --toon subtask show <id> 2>/dev/null
```

If the ID is a task or subtask, resolve its parent epic and scope `session`,
`suggest`, and `epic progress` to that epic. If the user asked to execute a task
or subtask, start with that item; continue broader epic execution only when it
matches the user intent.

| User signal | Mode |
|---|---|
| ID only | Orient: `session --epic <epic-id>` or show the item |
| `status`, `progress`, `analyze`, `review`, `check` | Analyze: `epic progress`, targeted show, then `suggest --epic` |
| `plan`, `break down`, `design`, `architect` | Plan |
| `execute`, `implement`, `do`, `complete`, `start`, `run` | Execute |
| `team execute`, `execute with team` | Team execute |

## Completion Rules

- Plan mode is complete only when the epic exists, tasks/subtasks/dependencies
  exist in Trekoon, the graph is validated, and the user gets the epic ID plus
  first execution wave.
- Orient mode is complete when the user knows current state, blockers, ready
  work, and the likely next command.
- Execute mode is complete only when the epic is marked `done`, all remaining
  work is blocked with recorded reasons, or real user input is required.

## Execution Defaults

- Start with `session`; scope with `--epic <id>` when known.
- If ready work exists, keep moving. After each `task done`, inspect
  `unblocked`, `warning`/`openSubtaskIds`, and `next`.
- When executing an epic, use subagents by default for meaningful independent
  work. Keep small or tightly coupled tasks in the parent agent.
- Use your context for orchestration, dependency decisions, user communication,
  and final synthesis. Your job is to finish the epic, not personally perform
  every implementation step.
- If a higher-priority harness rule blocks subagents without explicit user
  wording, ask immediately.
- For non-trivial implementation, run relevant tests and a separate review pass.
  Record checks and review results in Trekoon before closing work.

## Non-Negotiables

- Use `--toon` on every Trekoon command.
- Treat Trekoon updates as workflow state, not after-the-fact bookkeeping.
- Prefer smallest sufficient reads: `session`, `suggest`, `task ready`,
  `task next`, `dep list`, `dep reverse`, targeted `show`.
- Prefer transactional/bulk commands for planning and narrow `--ids` for bulk
  updates.
- In Claude Code, keep parallel `Bash` batches read-only for Trekoon commands.
  Only `task claim` and `subtask claim` are safe parallel write exceptions.
  Run `task done` and other status-changing commands sequentially after reading
  current state.
- Append progress, verification, and blocker notes with `--append`; do not
  rewrite descriptions unless fixing the plan itself.
- Preview search/replace before `--apply`.
- Never edit `.trekoon/trekoon.db` directly. Keep `.trekoon` gitignored.
- Never run `trekoon wipe --yes --toon` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Create branches, commits, merges, pushes, or PRs only when the user explicitly
  asks and the harness policy allows it.
- Use `--compact` in subagent prompts and noisy reads.

## Status Reminder

`task done` auto-transitions from `todo` or `blocked` through `in_progress`,
so prefer it for completion. Subtasks must claim or move through `in_progress`
before `done`. Load `reference/status-machine.md` for transition errors or
uncertainty.

## Recovery

If diagnostics show `recoveryRequired`, stop task selection and run:

```bash
trekoon --toon init
trekoon --toon sync status
```

If sync is behind or conflicts exist, resolve that before claiming work. Load
`reference/sync.md` for conflict handling.
